Description: The online interface for Wormbase Parasite (https://parasite.wormbase.org/biomart)
    is a web-based query designer to bioMart. It is interactive, allowing the user to figure out the
    right fields to select to filter and return as results. The configured query may be saved without
    running in a few different formats, including XML. This packages translates that XML into R syntax
    to run in the bioMart package (biomaRt).
